  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p>Violence against women is now recognised to be a serious and widespread problem in Australia, with enormous individual and community impacts and social costs.</p>
  <p>The following basic statistics (from <a href="https://www.ourwatch.org.au/understanding-violence/facts-and-figures">Our Watch</a>) help demonstrate the prevalence and severity of violence against women:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>On average, one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner.(1)
    </li>
    <li>1 in 3 Australian women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15.(2)
    </li>
    <li>1 in 5 Australian women has experienced sexual violence.(3)
    </li>
    <li>1 in 6 Australian women has experienced physical or sexual violence by current or former partner.(4)
    </li>
    <li>1 in 4 Australian women has experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner.(5)
    </li>
    <li>Australian women are nearly three times more likely than men to experience violence from an intimate partner.(6)
    </li>
    <li>Australian women are almost four times more likely than men to be hospitalised after being assaulted by their spouse or partner.(7)
    </li>
    <li>Women are more than twice as likely as men to have experienced fear or anxiety due to violence from a former partner.(8)
    </li>
    <li>More than two-thirds (68%) of mothers who had children in their care when they experienced violence from their previous partner said their children had seen or heard the violence.(9)
    </li>
    <li>Almost one in 10 women (9.4%) have experienced violence by a stranger since the age of 15.(10)
    </li>
    <li>Young women (18 – 24 years) experience significantly higher rates of physical and sexual violence than women in older age groups.(11)
    </li>
    <li>There is growing evidence that women with disabilities are more likely to experience violence.(12)
    </li>
    <li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women report experiencing violence in the previous.12 months at 3.1 times the rate of non-Indigenous women.(13)
    </li>
    <li>In 2014–15, Indigenous women were 32 times as likely to be hospitalised due to family violence as non-Indigenous women.(14)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Concept</h2>

  <p>This is a concept design for an app that supports and encourages women record incidents and report abuse to the police quickly, and easily, as well as to receive emergency help if they need it.
  </p>
  <p>My thinking is that the app could be helpful for a large percentage of Australian women to have, except perhaps those currently in abusive relationships as it may aggrevate and even cause harm in this circumstance.
  </p>
  <p>The concept was inspired by the problem of the one-off time someone is abused, but aren't ready to report it straight away. If they make a record then decide to take action years later (as did Christine Blasey Ford) then they wouldn't have to rely on their memory so much.
  </p>
  <p>The GPS emergency button feature was included to address the problem faced by someone who finds themselves in immediate danger and requires assistance ASAP. Ideally, this request would send directly to the local emergency police force.
  </p>
